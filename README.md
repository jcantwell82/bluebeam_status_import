# bluebeam_status_import

Ability to replace status for Bluebeam profile with a template profile. As Bluebeam does not allow importing of status, it allows a company to migrate out updates or new statuses to all employees based on a tempalte profile. The software is written open ended, where the company/user can edit the yaml file to point to the tempalte profile, and if they prefer, to rename the profile instead of writing it over. It has the user select which profile they want to update, in the event they have multiple profiles, with ones they do not want to update the statuses.

Works with Bluebeam Version 21 (all revisions).
